## Current Setup: NEON_GLOW ⚡

**Why it's great:**
- ✅ Perfect balance of tech and elegance
- ✅ Cyberpunk aesthetic matches your gradient background
- ✅ Individual letter attention = memorable
- ✅ Not too aggressive, not too plain
- ✅ Safari-tested and buttery smooth

**When to change:**
- 🔄 Too "flashy" for corporate roles → Try `TYPEWRITER_MODERN`
- 🔄 Want more "AI" feel → Try `MATRIX_DECODE`
- 🔄 Want bolder statement → Try `MAGNETIC_PULL`
- 🔄 Want sci-fi theme → Try `HOLOGRAM_FLICKER`

## Pro Tips

### Matching Animation to Your Background

Your gradient mesh background is **fluid and organic**. Best pairs:

1. **NEON_GLOW** ⭐ - Electric + Fluid = Cyberpunk perfection
2. **MAGNETIC_PULL** - Chaotic + Fluid = Creative energy
3. **HOLOGRAM_FLICKER** - Tech + Fluid = Futuristic elegance

Avoid potential conflicts:
- ❌ **PIXEL_ASSEMBLE** might feel too "retro" vs modern gradient
- ⚠️ **GLITCH_CYBER** might be too chaotic with moving background

### Testing on Different Devices

**Desktop** - All animations look great, pick based on personality
**Mobile** - Simpler animations (WAVE_REVEAL, TYPEWRITER) more reliable
**Tablet** - Sweet spot, all work well

### Performance Note

All animations are optimized, but if you notice lag:
- **Lightest**: `TYPEWRITER_MODERN`, `WAVE_REVEAL`
- **Medium**: `NEON_GLOW`, `MATRIX_DECODE`, `PIXEL_ASSEMBLE`
- **Heaviest**: `HOLOGRAM_FLICKER`, `MAGNETIC_PULL`, `GLITCH_CYBER`
